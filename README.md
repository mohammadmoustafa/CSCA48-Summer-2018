### Office Hours
I do not have any office hours. If you need help, you should first check to see if your question has already been asked on Piazza. If it has not been, you can ask it on Piazza (do this first) or email me for help. If it would benefit students (and I have time in my schedule) I can try and set up occasional office hours upon request.
